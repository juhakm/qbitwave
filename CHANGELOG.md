# CHANGELOG.md

## Version 0.2.1 — "Wavefunction-Centric Rewrite"
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Core Concept:** Quantum behavior emerges statistically from information compressibility.

### Conceptual Shift
- **New model:** `QBitwaveND` treats the *wavefunction itself* as fundamental.
  - The bitstring representation is optional, not required.
  - The system evolves in continuous or discrete N-dimensional configuration space.
  - All physical structure (energy, motion, probability) emerges from transformations in amplitude space.

In short:
> **The wavefunction now *is* the information.**
> Bit patterns are its discrete projections.



### Structural Changes

**Primary Data:**  `amplitudes` (NumPy N-D complex array)
**Core Idea:** Information density patterns form emergent quantum amplitudes
**Dimensionality:** Explicit N-D shape of amplitude array
**Entropy:** Amplitude magnitude statistics via probability density
**Compressibility:** Interpreted as spatial frequency sparsity in Fourier domain
**Mutation / Flip:** Smooth evolution, phase propagation via FFT
**Normalization:** Automatic unitary evolution preserves norm
**Evaluation:**  Continuous evaluation using inverse FFT and phase evolution
**Time Evolution:** Explicit temporal dynamics: `time_evolve_coeffs(t)`
**Representation:** Functional `evaluate(x₁, x₂, ..., t)` returning complex amplitude


### New Features
- **Multi-Dimensional Support:** Works with arbitrary N-dimensional amplitude tensors.
- **Frequency-Domain Representation:** Uses FFT for spatial-temporal evolution.
- **Unitary Time Evolution:** Applies `exp(-i * ω * t)` phase factor to Fourier coefficients.
- **Probabilistic Evaluation:** Returns `|ψ(x,t)|²` as emergent probability density.
- **Mass and Constants:** Optional `mass`, `ħ`, `c` parameters for scaling dynamics.
- **Continuous Coordinates:** Supports floating-point sampling in any spatial dimension.


### Philosophical Notes
- The rewrite aligns with the **information-theoretic hypothesis**:
  > *Quantum probability arises naturally from statistical bias toward compressible configurations.*
- The N-D version **removes all baked-in physics** — no Hamiltonian, no particle postulates.
  Instead, **patterns in informational density** (Fourier sparsity) are treated as emergent “physical laws”.
- The new structure allows viewing any wavefunction as a **minimal program** producing its own informational pattern — satisfying the principle of self-generated reality.


### Testing and Validation
- The old unit tests (`test_qbitwave.py`) relied on bitstring operations.
- A new test suite (`qbitwavend_test.py`) now validates:
  - normalization of FFT coefficients
  - probability non-negativity
  - temporal phase consistency
  - shape and type safety for N-D arrays
- The tests confirm **unitary evolution** and **stable probability evaluation**.
